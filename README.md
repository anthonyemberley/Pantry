# Pantry
Pantry is a platform where users are able to keep track of all the items in their pantry. The
platform will have profiles where users can see their own pantry and favorite recipes. Using
this knowledge, we are able to provide the users of the platform the options to see recipes
that closely match the ingredients that they already have. We will have a place where users
can explore recipes that interest them as well as fit with what they already have in their
pantry. The product also has a feature for shopping lists that will add ingredients that
you don’t have automatically if you pick a recipe to make. Users are also able to create
their own recipes and add them to the public database.

# Key Purposes
● Track pantry items for users
  ○ We are tracking the items a user has in their pantry to solve the problem of not
  knowing what can be made from ingredients that you already have.
● Help people find what they want to cook
  ○ Oftentimes, people have a pantry full of ingredients, but aren’t sure what how to
  combine them to make a meal. We will help them by recommending recipes that
  are similar to ones they have liked in the past.
● Post and review recipes
  ○ Posting recipes allows people to share the culture that develops from their cuisine
  with people around the world. Adding the review feature allows users to share
  their experiences trying other types of cuisines and recipes.
